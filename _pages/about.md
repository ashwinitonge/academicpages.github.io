I am a Ph.D. student at Kansas State University, Manhattan where I work as a Research Assistant under the supervision of my adviser Dr. Cornelia Caragea. My current work involves privacy setting prediction for online images using Deep Learning.  For this, I am using the visual content features derived using deep neural networks and associated tags. Before transferring to KSU, I have completed my Master's in Computer Science in Fall 2016 at University of North Texas, Denton. My research interests involve machine learning, computer vision, and graph theory.
